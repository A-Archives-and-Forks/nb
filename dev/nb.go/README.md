# `nb.go`

`nb.go` is an under-development implementation of `nb` written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Goals:

- Improved Windows support. Runnable in a default windows install, or as close to default as possible.
- 1 to 1 feature parity with `nb`, passing the same test suite.
- Continuously usable during development, falling back to `nb` for unimplemented features.
- Transparent performance improvements for `nb` when `nb.go` is installed.
- Single file with no dependencies outside of the [Go standard library](https://golang.org/pkg/).
