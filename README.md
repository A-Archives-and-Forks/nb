# `‚ùØ nb`

`nb` is a command line note-taking, bookmarking, and archiving
application with:

- plain-text data storage,
- encryption,
- filtering and search,
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)-backed versioning and syncing,
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)-backed conversion,
- global and local notebooks,
- customizable [color themes](#built-in-color-themes),

and more, all in a single portable, user-friendly script.

`nb` creates notes in text-based formats like
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
[Emacs Org mode](https://orgmode.org/),
and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/),
can work with files in any format, can import and export notes to many
document formats, and can create private, password-protected encrypted
notes and bookmarks. With `nb`, you can write notes using Vim, Emacs,
VS Code, Sublime Text, and any other text editor you prefer. `nb` works in
any standard Linux / Unix environment, including macOS and Windows via WSL.
[Optional dependencies](#optional) can be installed to enhance functionality,
but `nb` works great without them.

        alt="home"
        width="450">
</p>

`nb` is also a powerful text-based CLI bookmarking system that includes:

- local full-text search of cached page content with regular expression support,
- tagging,
- convenient filtering and listing,
- [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) snapshot lookup for
  broken links,
- and easy viewing of bookmarked pages in the terminal and your regular web browser.

Page information is automatically downloaded, compiled, and saved into normal Markdown
documents made for humans, so bookmarks are easy to edit just like any other note.

        alt="bookmarks"
        width="450">
</p>

`nb` uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in the background to automatically
record changes and sync notebooks with remote repositories.
`nb` can also be configured to sync notebooks with a general purpose
syncing utility like Dropbox so notes can be edited in other apps
on any device.

        alt="welcome"
        width="450">
</p>

`nb` is designed to be portable, future-focused, and vendor independent,
providing a full-featured, intuitive experience within a composable
user-centric text interface.
The entire program is a single well-tested shell script
that can be copied or `curl`ed almost anywhere and just work, using
[progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
for various experience improvements in more capable environments. `nb` works great
whether you have one notebook with just a few notes or dozens of
notebooks containing many thousands of notes, bookmarks, and other items.
`nb` makes it easy to incorporate other tools, writing apps, and workflows.
`nb` can be used a little, a lot, once in a while, or for just a subset of
features. `nb` is flexible.

### Installation

#### macOS / Homebrew

To install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install xwmx/taps/nb
```

Installing `nb` with Homebrew also installs the recommended dependencies
and completion scripts.

#### Ubuntu, Windows WSL, and others

##### Download and Install

To install as an administrator, copy and paste one of the following multi-line
commands:

```bash
# install using wget
sudo wget https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -O /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo nb env install

# install using curl
sudo curl -L https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -o /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo nb env install
```

This will also install the completion scripts on all systems and the
recommended dependencies on Ubuntu and WSL.

###### User-only Installation

To install with just user permissions, simply add the `nb` script to your
`$PATH`. If you already have a `~/bin` directory, for example, you can use
one of the following commands:

```bash
# download with wget
wget https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -O ~/bin/nb && chmod +x ~/bin/nb

# download with curl
curl -L https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -o ~/bin/nb && chmod +x ~/bin/nb
```

Installing with just user permissions doesn't include the optional
dependencies or completions, but `nb` works without them. If you have
`sudo` access and want to install the completion scripts and
dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
sudo nb env install
```

##### Make

To install with [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)),
clone this repository, navigate to the clone's root directory, and run:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This will also install the completion scripts on all systems and the
recommended dependencies on Ubuntu and WSL.

##### npm

To install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notes.sh):

```bash
npm install -g notes.sh
```

Installing through `npm` only installs completion scripts.
On Ubuntu and WSL, you can run `sudo nb env install` to install the
optional dependencies.

##### bpkg

To install with [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg):

```bash
bpkg install xwmx/nb
```

#### Tab Completion

Bash and Zsh tab completion should be enabled when `nb` is installed using
the methods above, assuming you have the appropriate system
permissions or installed with `sudo`. If completion isn't working after
installing `nb`, see the [completion installation
instructions](etc/README.md).

#### Updating

When `nb` is installed using a package manager like npm or
Homebrew, use the package manager's upgrade functionality to update `nb` to
the latest version. When installed via other methods, `nb` can be updated to
the latest version using the [`nb update`](#update) subcommand.

</p>

To get started, simply run:

```bash
nb
```

`nb` sets up your initial "home" notebook the first time it runs.

By default, notebooks and notes are global (at `~/.nb`), so they are always available to
`nb` regardless of the current working directory. `nb` also supports [local
notebooks](#global-and-local-notebooks).

### üìù Notes

#### Adding Notes

Use `nb add` to create new notes:

```bash
# create a new note in your text editor
nb add

# create a new note with the filename "example.md"
nb add example.md

# create a new note containing "This is a note."
nb add "This is a note."

# create a new note with piped content
echo "Note content." | nb add

# create a new password-protected, encrypted note titled "Secret Document"
nb add --title "Secret Document" --encrypt
```

`nb add` with no arguments or input will open the new, blank note in your
environment's preferred text editor. You can change your editor using the
`$EDITOR` environment variable or [`nb set editor`](#settings-list---long).

`nb` files are [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
files by default. The default file type can be changed to whatever you
like using [`nb set default_extension`](#settings-list---long).

Password-protected notes are created with the `-e` / `--encrypt` flag
and are encrypted with AES-256 using OpenSSL by default.
GPG is also supported and can be configured with
[`nb set encryption_tool`](#settings-list---long).
Encrypted notes can be decrypted using the OpenSSL and GPG command line
tools directly, so you aren't dependent on `nb` to decrypt your
files.

`nb add` behaves differently depending on the type of argument it
receives. When a filename with extension is specified, a new note
with that filename is opened in the editor:

```bash
nb add example.md
```

When a string is specified, a new note is immediately created with that
string as the content and the editor is not opened:

```bash
> nb add "This is a note."
Added [5] 20200101000000.md
```

`nb add <string>` is useful for quickly jotting down notes directly
via the command line.

When no filename is specified, `nb add` uses the current datetime as
the filename.

`nb add` can also recieve piped content, which behaves the same as
`nb add <string>`:

```bash
# create a new note containing "Note content."
> echo "Note content." | nb add
Added [6] 20200101000100.md

# create a new note containing the clipboard contents on macOS
> pbpaste | nb add
Added [7] 20200101000200.md

# create a new note containing the clipboard contents using xclip
> xclip -o | nb add
Added [8] 20200101000300.md
```

Content can be passed with the `--content` option, which will also
create a new note without opening the editor:

```bash
nb add --content "Note content."
```

When content is piped, specified with `--content`, or passed as a
string argument, use the `--edit` flag to open the file in the editor
before the change is committed.

The title, filename, and content can also be specified with long and
short options:

```bash
> nb add --filename "example.md" -t "Example Title" -c "Example content."
Added [9] example.md 'Example Title'
```

The `-t <title>` / `--title <title>` option will also set the filename
to the title, with spaces replaced with underscores:

```bash
> nb add --title "Example Title" "Example content."
Added [10] Example_Title.md 'Example Title'
```

Files can be created with any file type either by specifying the
extension in the filename or via the `--type <type>` option:

```bash
# open a new org mode file in the editor
nb add example.org

# open a new reStructuredText file in the editor
nb add --type rst
```

For a full list of options available for `nb add`, run [`nb help add`](#add).

##### Shortcut Alias: `a`

`nb` includes single-character shortcuts for many commands, including
`a` for `add`:

```bash
# create a new note in your text editor
nb a

# create a new note with the filename "example.md"
nb a example.md

# create a new note containing "This is a note."
nb a "This is a note."

# create a new note containing the clipboard contents with xclip
xclip -o | nb a
```

##### Other Aliases: `create`, `new`

`nb add` can also be invoked with `nb create` and `nb new` for convenience:

```bash
# create a new note containing "Example note content."
nb new "Example note content."

# create a new note with the title "Example Note Title"
nb create --title "Example Note Title"
```

#### Listing Notes

To list notes and notebooks, run `nb ls`:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[3] example.md ¬∑ "Example content."
[2] todos.md ¬∑ "Todos:"
[1] ideas.md ¬∑ "- Example idea one."
```

Notebooks are listed above the line, with the current notebook
highlighted and/or underlined, depending on terminal capabilities.
`nb ls` also includes a footer with example commands for easy reference.
The notebook header and command footer can be configured or hidden with
[`nb set header`](#settings-list---long) and
[`nb set footer`](#settings-list---long).

Notes from the current notebook are listed in the order they were last
modified. By default, each note is listed with its id, filename, and an
excerpt from the first line of the note. When a note has a title, the
title is displayed instead of the filename and first line.

Titles can be defined within a note using
[either Markdown `h1` style](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header)
or [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```markdown
# Example Title
```

```markdown
Todos
=====
```

```markdown
---
title: Ideas
---
```

Once defined, titles will be displayed in place of the filename and first line
in the output of `nb ls`:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[3] Example Title
[2] Todos
[1] Ideas
```

Pass an id, filename, or title to view the listing for that note:

```bash
> nb ls Todos
[2] Todos
```

```bash
> nb ls 3
[3] Example Title
```

If there is no immediate match, `nb` will list items with titles and
filenames that fuzzy match the query:

```bash
> nb ls "idea"
[1] Ideas
```

A case-insensitive regular expression can also be used to filter
filenames and titles:

```bash
> nb ls "^example.*"
[3] Example Title
```

For full text search, see [Search](#-search).

To view excerpts of notes, use the `--excerpt` or `-e` option, which
optionally accepts a length:

```bash
> nb ls 3 --excerpt
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

This is an example excerpt.

> nb ls 3 -e 8
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

This is an example excerpt.

More example content:
- one
- two
- three
```

Bookmarks and encrypted notes are indicated with `üîñ` and `üîí`, making them
easily identifiable in lists:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[4] Example Note
[3] üîí example-encrypted.md.enc
[2] üîñ Example Bookmark (example.com)
[1] üîñ üîí example-encrypted.bookmark.md.enc
```

By default, items are listed starting with the most recently modified.
To reverse the order, use the `-r` or `--reverse` flag:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[2] Todos
[3] Example Title
[1] Ideas

> nb ls --reverse
[1] Ideas
[3] Example Title
[2] Todos
```

Notes can be sorted with the `-s` / `--sort` flag, which can be combined
with `-r` / `--reverse`:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[2] Todos
[3] Example Title
[1] Ideas

> nb ls --sort
[1] Ideas
[2] Todos
[3] Example Title

> nb ls --sort --reverse
[3] Example Title
[2] Todos
[1] Ideas
```

`nb` with no subcommand behaves like an alias for `nb ls`, so the examples
above can be run without the `ls`:

```bash
> nb
home
----
[2] Todos
[3] Example Title
[1] Ideas

> nb "^example.*"
[3] Example Title

> nb 3 --excerpt
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

This is an example excerpt.

> nb 3 -e 8
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

This is an example excerpt.

More example content:
- one
- two
- three

> nb --sort
[1] Ideas
[2] Todos
[3] Example Title

> nb --sort --reverse
[3] Example Title
[2] Todos
[1] Ideas
```

Short options can be combined for brevity:

```bash
# equivalent to `nb --sort --reverse --excerpt 2` and `nb -s -r -e 2`:
> nb -sre 2
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

[2] Todos
---------
Todos
=====
[1] Ideas
---------
---
title: Ideas
```

`nb` and `nb ls` display the 20 most recently modified items. The default
limit can be changed with [`nb set limit <number>`](#settings-list---long).
To list a different number of items on a per-command basis, use the `-n`,
`--limit`, `--<limit>`, `-a`, or `--all` flags:

```bash
> nb -n 2
home
----
[5] Example Five
[4] Example Four
3 omitted. 5 total.

> nb --3
home
----
[5] Example Five
[4] Example Four
[3] Example Three
2 omitted. 5 total.

> nb --all
home
----
[5] Example Five
[4] Example Four
[3] Example Three
[2] Example Two
[1] Example One
```

`nb ls` is a combination of [`nb notebooks`](#notebooks) and [`nb list`](#list)
in one view and accepts the same arguments as `nb list`, which lists only
notes without the notebook list and with no limit by default:

```bash
> nb list
[100] Example One Hundred
[99]  Example Ninety-Nine
[98]  Example Ninety-Eight
... lists all notes ...
[2]   Example Two
[1]   Example One
```

For more information about options for listing notes, run [`nb help ls`](#ls)
and [`nb help list`](#list).

#### Editing Notes

You can edit a note in your editor using its id, filename, or title:

```bash
# edit note by id
nb edit 3

# edit note by filename
nb edit example.md

# edit note by title
nb edit "A Document Title"
```

`edit` and other subcommands that take an identifier can be called with the
identifier and subcommand name reversed:

```bash
# edit note by id
nb 3 edit
```

`nb edit` can also receive piped content, which it will append to the
specified note without opening the editor:

```bash
echo "Content to append." | nb edit 1
```

Content can be passed with the `--content` option, which will also
append the content without opening the editor:

```bash
nb edit 1 --content "Content to append."
```

When content is piped or specified with `--content`, use the `--edit`
flag to open the file in the editor before the change is committed.

##### Editing Encrypted Notes

When a note is encrypted, `nb edit` will prompt you for the note password,
open the unencrypted content in your editor, and then automatically reencrypt
the note when you are done editing.

##### Shortcut Alias: `e`

Like `add`, `edit` has a shortcut alias, `e`:

```bash
# edit note by id
nb e 3

# edit note by filename
nb e example.md

# edit note by title
nb e "A Document Title"

# edit note by id, alternative
nb 3 e
```

For `nb edit` help information, run [`nb help edit`](#edit).

#### Viewing Notes

Notes can be viewed using `nb show`:

```bash
# show note by id
nb show 3

# show note by filename
nb show example.md

# show note by title
nb show "A Document Title"

# show note by id, alternative
nb 3 show
```

By default, `nb show` will open the note in
[`less`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less), with syntax highlighting if
[Pygments](https://pygments.org/) is installed. You can navigate in
`less` using the following keys:

```text
Key               Function
---               --------
mouse scroll      Scroll up or down
arrow up or down  Scroll one line up or down
f                 Jump forward one window
b                 Jump back one window
d                 Jump down one half window
u                 Jump up one half window
/<query>          Search for <query>
n                 Jump to next <query> match
q                 Quit
```

*Note: If `less` scrolling isn't working in [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/),
go to* "Settings" -> "Advanced" -> "Scroll wheel sends arrow keys when in
alternate screen mode" *and change it to* "Yes".
*[More info](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37610820)*

When [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is available, use the `--render` option to
render the note to HTML and open it in your terminal browser:

```bash
nb show example.md --render
# opens example.md as an HTML page in w3m or lynx
```

`nb show` also supports previewing other file types in the terminal,
depending on the tools available in the environment. Supported file types and
tools include:

- PDF files:
  - [`pdftotext`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext)
- Audio files:
  - [`mplayer`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer)
  - [`afplay`](https://ss64.com/osx/afplay.html)
  - [`mpg123`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpg123)
  - [`ffplay`](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html)
- Images:
  - [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
  - [`imgcat`](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)
  - [kitty's `icat` kitten](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html)
- Folders / Directories:
  - [`ranger`](https://ranger.github.io/)
  - [Midnight Commander (`mc`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander)

When using `nb show` with other file types or if the above tools are not
available, `nb show` will open files in your system's preferred application
for each type.

`nb show` is primarily intended for previewing notes and files within
the terminal. To view files in the system's preferred GUI application,
use [`nb open`](#import--export).

##### Shortcut Alias: `s`

`show` is aliased to `s`:

```bash
# show note by id
nb s 3

# show note by filename
nb s example.md

# show note by title
nb s "A Document Title"

# show note by id, alternative
nb 3 s
```

##### Alias: `view`

`nb show` can also be invoked with `nb view` for convenience:

```bash
# show note by id
nb view 3

# show note by filename
nb view example.md

# show note by title
nb view "A Document Title"

# show note by id, alternative
nb 3 view
```

For `nb show` help information, run [`nb help show`](#show).

#### Deleting Notes

Deleting notes works similarly to `edit` and `show`, accepting
an id, filename, or title to specify the note:

```bash
# delete note by id
nb delete 3

# delete note by filename
nb delete example.md

# delete note by title
nb delete "A Document Title"

# delete note by id, alternative
nb 3 delete
```

By default, `nb delete` will display a confirmation prompt. To skip, use the
`--force` / `-f` option:

```bash
nb delete 3 --force
```

##### Shortcut Alias: `d`

`delete` has the alias `d`:

```bash
# delete note by id
nb d 3

# delete note by filename
nb d example.md

# delete note by title
nb d "A Document Title"

# delete note by id, alternative
nb 3 d
```

For `nb delete` help information, run [`nb help delete`](#delete).

### üîñ Bookmarks

`nb` is a powerful bookmark management system, enabling you to to view, search,
and manage your bookmarks, links, and online references. Bookmarks are
Markdown notes containing information about the bookmarked page.

To create a new bookmark pass a URL as the first argument to `nb`:

```bash
nb https://example.com
```

`nb` automatically generates a bookmark using information from the page:

```markdown
# Example Title (example.com)

<https://example.com>

## Description

Example description.

## Content

`nb` embeds the page content in the bookmark, making it available for full
text search with `nb search`. When `pandoc` is installed, the HTML page
content will be converted to Markdown.

In addition to caching the page content, you can also include a quote from
the page using the `-q` / `--quote` option:

```bash
nb https://example.com --quote "Example quote line one.

Example quote line two."
```
```markdown
# Example Title (example.com)

<https://example.com>

## Description

Example description.

## Quote

> Example quote line one.
>
> Example quote line two.

Add a comment to a bookmark using the `-c` / `--comment` option:

```bash
nb https://example.com --comment "Example comment."
```
```markdown
# Example Title (example.com)

<https://example.com>

Bookmarks can be tagged using the `--tags` option. Tags are converted
into hashtags:

```bash
nb https://example.com --tags tag1,tag2
```
```markdown
# Example Title (example.com)

<https://example.com>

## Description

Example description.

## Tags

```

Search for tagged bookmarks with `nb search`:

```bash
nb search "#tag1"
```

`nb search` automatically searches archived page content:

```bash
> nb search "example query"
[10] example.bookmark.md "Example Bookmark (example.com)"
---------------------------------------------------------
5:Lorem ipsum example query.
```

Bookmarks can also be encrypted:

```bash
# create a new password-protected, encrypted bookmark
nb https://example.com --encrypt
```

Encrypted bookmarks require a password before they can be viewed or
opened.

`nb bookmark` and `nb bookmark list` can be used to list and
filter bookmarks:

```bash
> nb bookmark
Add: nb <url> Help: nb help bookmark
------------------------------------
[3] üîñ üîí example.bookmark.md.enc
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
[1] üîñ Example One (example.com)

> nb bookmark list two
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
```

##### Shortcut Alias: `b`

`bookmark` can also be used with the alias `b`:

```bash
> nb b
Add: nb <url> Help: nb help bookmark
------------------------------------
[3] üîñ üîí example.bookmark.md.enc
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
[1] üîñ Example One (example.com)

> nb b two
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
```

#### Opening and Viewing Bookmarked Pages

`nb` provides multiple ways to view bookmarked web pages.

`nb open` opens the bookmarked page in your
system's primary web browser:

```bash
# open bookmark by id
nb open 3
```

`nb peek` (alias: `preview`) opens the bookmarked page in your
terminal web browser, such as
[w3m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m) or
[Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)):

```bash
# peek bookmark by id
nb peek 12
```
`open` and `peek` subcommands also work seamlessly with encrypted bookmarks.
`nb` will simply prompt you for the bookmark's password.

`open` and `peek` automatically check whether the URL is still valid.
If the page has been removed, `nb` can check the [Internet Archive
Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) for an archived copy.

`nb show` and `nb edit` can also be used to view and edit bookmark files,
which include the cached page converted to Markdown.

`nb show <id> --render` displays the bookmark file converted to HTML in
the terminal web browser, including all bookmark fields and the cached page
content, providing a cleaned-up, distraction-free, locally-served view of
the page content along with all of your notes.

##### Shortcut Aliases: `o` and `p`

`open` and `peek` can also be used with the shortcut aliases `o` and
`p`:

```bash
# open bookmark by id
nb o 3

# peek bookmark by id
nb p 12
```

#### Bookmark File Format

Bookmarks are identified by a `.bookmark.md` file extension. The
bookmark URL is the first URL in the file within `<` and `>` characters.
To create a minimally valid bookmark file with `nb add`:

```bash
nb add example.bookmark.md --content "<https://example.com>"
```

For a full overview, see
[`nb` Markdown Bookmark File Format](#nb-markdown-bookmark-file-format).

#### `bookmark` -- A command line tool for managing bookmarks.

`nb` includes `bookmark`, a full-featured command line interface for
creating, viewing, searching, and editing bookmarks.

`bookmark` is a shortcut for the `nb bookmark` subcommand, accepting all
of the same subcommands and options with identical behavior.

Bookmark a page:

```bash
> bookmark https://example.com --tags tag1,tag2
Added [3] 20200101000000.bookmark.md "Example Title (example.com)"
```
List and filter bookmarks with `bookmark` and `bookmark list`:

```bash
> bookmark
Add: bookmark <url> Help: bookmark help
---------------------------------------
[3] üîñ üîí example.bookmark.md.enc
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
[1] üîñ Example One (example.com)

> bookmark list two
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
```

View a bookmark in your terminal web browser:

```bash
> bookmark peek 2
```

Open a bookmark in your system's primary web browser:

```bash
> bookmark open 2
```

Perform a full text search of bookmarks and archived page content:

```bash
> bookmark search "example query"
[10] example.bookmark.md "Example Bookmark (example.com)"
---------------------------------------------------------
5:Lorem ipsum example query.
```

See [`bookmark help`](#bookmark-help) for more information.

### üîç Search

Use `nb search` to search your notes, with support for regular
expressions and tags:

```bash
# search current notebook for "example query"
nb search "example query"

# search all active notebooks for "example query"
nb search "example query" --all

# search for "Example" OR "Sample"
nb search "Example|Sample"

# search items containing the hashtag "#example"
nb search "#example"

# search with a regular expression for items containing phone numbers
nb search "^(1?(-?\d{3})-?)?(\d{3})(-?\d{4})$"

# search bookmarks for "example"
nb search "example" --type bookmark
```

`nb search` prints the id number, filename, and title of each matched
file, followed by each search query match and its line number, with color
highlighting:

```bash
> nb search "example"
[314]  example.bookmark.md "Example Bookmark (example.com)"
----------------------------------------------------------
1:# Example Bookmark (example.com)

3:<https://example.com>

[2718] example.md "Example Note"
--------------------------------
1:# Example Note
```

To just print the note information line without the content matches, use
the `-l` or `--list` option:

```bash
> nb search "example" --list
[314]  example.bookmark.md "Example Bookmark (example.com)"
[2718] example.md "Example Note"
```

`nb search` looks for [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep),
[`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher),
[`ack`](https://beyondgrep.com/), and
[`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep), in that order, and
performs searches using the first tool it finds. `nb search` works
mostly the same regardless of which tool is found and is perfectly fine using
the environment's built-in `grep`. `rg`, `ag`, and `ack` are faster and there
are some subtle differences in color highlighting.

##### Shortcut Alias: `q`

`search` can also be used with the alias `q` (for "query"):

```bash
# search for "example" and print matching excerpts
nb q "example"

# search for "example" and list each matching file
nb q -l "example"

# search for "example" in all unarchived notebooks
nb q -a "example"
```

For more information about search, see [`nb help search`](#search).

### üóí Revision History

Whenever a note is added, modified, or deleted, `nb` automatically commits
the change to git transparently in the background. You can view the history of
the notebook or an individual note with:

```bash
# show history for current notebook
nb history

# show history for note number 4
nb history 4

# show history for note with filename example.md
nb history example.md

# show history for note titled "Example"
nb history Example
```

`nb history` uses `git log` by default and prefers
[`tig`](https://github.com/jonas/tig) when available.

### üìîüììüìí Notebooks

You can create additional notebooks, each of which has its own version history.

Create a new notebook with `nb notebooks add`:

```bash
# add a notebook named example
nb notebooks add example
```

`nb` and `nb ls` list the available notebooks above the list of notes:

```bash
> nb ls
example ¬∑ home
--------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

Commands in `nb` run within the current notebook, and identifiers like id,
filename, and title refer to notes within the current notebook.
`nb edit 3`, for example, tells `nb` to `edit` note with id `3` within the
current notebook.

To switch to a different notebook, use `nb use`:

```bash
# switch to the notebook named "example"
nb use example
```

If you are in one notebook and you want to perform a command in a
different notebook without switching to it, add the notebook name with a
colon before the command name:

```bash
# add a new note in the notebook "example"
nb example:add

# add a new note in the notebook "example", shortcut alias
nb example:a

# show note 5 in the notebook "example"
nb example:show 5

# show note 5 in the notebook "example", shortcut alias
nb example:s 5

# edit note 12 in the notebook "example"
nb example:edit 12

# edit note 12 in the notebook "example", shortcut alias
nb example:e 12

# search for "example query" in the notebook "example"
nb example:search "example query"

# search for "example query" in the notebook "example", shortcut alias
nb example:q "example query"

# show the revision history of the notebook "example"
nb example:history
```

The notebook name with colon can also be used as a modifier to the id,
filename, or title:

```bash
# edit note 12 in the notebook "example"
nb edit example:12

# edit note 12 in the notebook "example", shortcut alias
nb e example:12

# edit note 12 in the notebook "example", alternative
nb example:12 edit

# edit note 12 in the notebook "example", alternative, shortcut alias
nb example:12 e

# show note titled "misc" in the notebook "example"
nb show example:misc

# show note titled "misc" in the notebook "example", shortcut alias
nb s example:misc

# delete note with filename "todos.md" in the notebook "example", alternative
nb example:todos.md delete

# delete note with filename "todos.md" in the notebook "example", alternative,
# shortcut alias
nb example:todos.md d
```

When a notebook name with colon is called without a subcommand, `nb` runs
`nb ls` in the specified notebook:

```bash
> nb example:
example ¬∑ home
--------------
[example:3] Title Three
[example:2] Title Two
[example:1] Title One
```

A bookmark can be created in another notebook by specifying the notebook
name with colon, then a space, then the URL and bookmark options:

```bash
# create a new bookmark in a notebook named "sample"
> nb sample: https://example.com --tags tag1,tag2
```

Notes can also be moved between notebooks:

```bash
# move note 3 from the current notebook to "example"
nb move 3 example

# move note 5 in the notebook "example" to the notebook "sample"
nb move example:5 sample
```

##### Notebooks and Tab Completion

[`nb` tab completion](#tab-completion) is optimized for frequently running
commands in various notebooks using the colon syntax, so installing the
completion scripts is recommended and makes working with notebooks easy
and fun.

For example, listing the contents of a notebook is usually as simple as typing
the first two or three characters of the name, then press the \<tab\> key,
then press \<enter\>:

```bash
> nb exa<tab>
# completes to "example:"
> nb example:
example ¬∑ home
--------------
[example:3] Title Three
[example:2] Title Two
[example:1] Title One
```

Scoped notebook commands are also available in tab completion:

```bash
> nb exa<tab>
# completes to "example:"
> nb example:hi<tab>
# completes to "example:history"
```

#### Notebooks, Tags, and Taxonomy

`nb` is optimized to work with multiple notebooks, so notebooks are a
good way to organize your notes and bookmarks by top-level topic. Tags
are searchable across notebooks and can be created ad hoc, making notebooks
and tags distinct and complementary organizational systems in `nb`.

Search for a tag in or across notebooks with `nb search` / `nb q`:

```bash
# search for #tag in the current notebook
nb q "#tag"

# search for #tag in all notebooks
nb q "#tag" -a

# search for #tag in the "example" notebook
nb example:q "#tag"
```

#### Global and Local Notebooks

##### Global Notebooks

By default, all `nb` notebooks are global, making them always accessible in
the terminal regardless of the current working directory. Global notebooks are
stored in the directory configured in [`NB_DIR`](#settings-list---long), which is
`~/.nb` by default.

##### Local Notebooks

`nb` also supports creating and working with local notebooks. Local
notebooks are notebooks that are anywhere on the system outside
of `NB_DIR`. Any folder can be an `nb` local notebook, which is just a normal
folder that has been initialized as a git repository and contains an `nb`
.index file. Initializing a folder as an `nb` local notebook is a very easy
way to add structured git versioning to any folder of documents and
other files.

When `nb` runs within a local notebook, the local notebook is set as the
current notebook:

```bash
> nb ls
local ¬∑ example ¬∑ home
----------------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

A local notebook is always referred to by the name `local` and otherwise
behaves just like a global notebook whenever a command is run from within it:

```bash
# add a new note in the local notebook
nb add

# edit note 15 in the local notebook
nb edit 15

# move note titled "Todos" from the home notebook to the local notebook
nb move home:Todos local

# move note 1 from the local notebook to the home notebook
nb move 1 home

# search the local notebook for <query string>
nb search "query string"

# search the local notebook and all global notebooks for <query string>
nb search "query string" --all
```

Local notebooks can be created with [`nb notebooks init`](#notebooks):

```bash
# initialize the current directory as a notebook
nb notebooks init

# create a new notebook at ~/example
nb notebooks init ~/example

# clone an existing notebook to ~/example
nb notebooks init ~/example https://github.com/example/example.git
```

Local notebooks can also be created by exporting a global notebook:

```bash
# export global notebook named "example" to "../path/to/destination"
nb notebooks export example ../path/to/destination
```

Local notebooks can also be imported, making them global:

```bash
# import notebook or folder at "../path/to/notebook"
nb notebooks import ../path/to/notebook
```

#### Archiving Notebooks

Notebooks can be archived:

```bash
# archive the current notebook
nb notebooks archive

# archive the notebook named "example"
nb notebooks archive example
```

When a notebook is archived it is not included in `ls` output,
`search --all`, or tab completion, nor synced automatically
with `sync --all`.

```bash
> nb ls
example1 ¬∑ example2 ¬∑ example3 ¬∑ [1 archived]
---------------------------------------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

Archived notebooks can still be used individually using normal notebook
commands:

```bash
# switch the current notebook to the archived notebook "example"
nb use example

# run the `list` subcommand in the archived notebook "example"
nb example:list
```

Check a notebook's archival status with `nb notebooks status`:

```bash
> nb notebooks status example
example is archived.
```

Unarchiving a notebook is simple:

```bash
# unarchive the current notebook
nb notebooks unarchive

# unarchive the notebook named "example"
nb notebooks unarchive example
```

For more information about working with notebooks, see
[`nb help notebooks`](#notebooks).

For technical details about notebooks, see
[`nb` Notebook Specification](#nb-notebook-specification).

### üîÑ Git Sync

Each notebook can be synced with a remote git repository by setting the
remote URL:

```bash
# set the current notebook's remote to a private GitHub repository
nb remote set https://github.com/example/example.git

# set the remote for the notebook named "example"
nb example:remote set https://github.com/example/example.git
```

Any notebook with a remote URL will sync automatically every time a command is
run in that notebook.

When you use `nb` on multiple systems, you can set a notebook on both
systems to the same remote and `nb` will keep everything in sync in the
background every time there's a change in that notebook.

Since each notebook has its own git history, you can have some notebooks
syncing with remotes while other notebooks are only available locally on that
system.

Many services provide free private git repositories, so git syncing with
`nb` is easy, free, and vendor-independent. You can also sync your notes
using Dropbox, Drive, Box, Syncthing, or another syncing tool by changing
your `nb` directory with [`nb set nb_dir <path>`](#settings-list---long)
and git syncing will still work simultaneously.

When you have an existing `nb` notebook in a git repository, simply
pass the URL to `nb notebooks add` and `nb` will clone your
existing notebook and start syncing changes automatically:

```bash
# create a new notebook named Example cloned from a private GitLab repository
nb notebooks add Example https://gitlab.com/example/example.git
```

Turn off syncing for a notebook by removing the remote:

```bash
# remove the remote from the current notebook
nb remote remove

# remove the remote from the notebook named "example"
nb example:remote remove
```

You can also turn off autosync with
[`nb set auto_sync`](#settings-list---long) and sync manually with
[`nb sync`](#sync).

### ‚ÜïÔ∏è Import / Export

Files of any type can be imported into a notebook. `nb edit` and `nb
open` will open files in your system's default application for that file type.

```bash
# import an image file
nb import ~/Pictures/example.png

# open image in your default image viewer
nb open example.png

# import a .docx file
nb import ~/Documents/example.docx

# open .docx file in Word or your system's .docx viewer
nb open example.docx
```

`nb import` can also download and import files directly from the web:

```bash
# import a PDF file from the web
nb import https://example.com/example.pdf
# Imported "https://example.com/example.pdf" to "example.pdf"

# open example.pdf in your system's PDF viewer
nb open example.pdf
```

Some imported file types have indicators to make them easier to identify in
lists:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[5] üåÑ example-picture.png
[4] üìÑ example-document.docx
[3] üìπ example-video.mp4
[2] üîâ example-audio.mp3
[1] üìÇ Example Folder
```

Notes can also be exported. If you have Pandoc installed, notes can
be converted to any of the
[formats supported by Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--to).
By default, the output format is determined by the file extension:

```bash
# Export a Markdown note to a .docx Microsoft Office Word document
nb export example.md /path/to/example.docx

# Export a note titled "Movies" to an HTML web page.
nb export Movies /path/to/example.html
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è `set` & Settings

[`nb set`](#settings) and [`nb settings`](#settings) open the settings
prompt, which provides an easy way to change your `nb` settings.

```bash
nb set
```

To update a setting in the prompt, enter the setting name or number,
then enter the new value, and `nb` will add the setting to your
`~/.nbrc` configuration file.

#### Example: editor

`nb` can be configured to use a specific command line editor using the
`editor` setting.

The settings prompt for a setting can be started by passing the setting
name or number to `nb set`:

```bash
> nb set editor
[6]  editor
     ------
     The command line text editor to use with `nb`.

     ‚Ä¢¬†Example Values:

         atom
         code
         emacs
         macdown
         mate
         micro
         nano
         pico
         subl
         vi
         vim

EDITOR is currently set to vim

Enter a new value, unset to set to the default value, or q to quit.
Value:
```

A setting can also be updated without the prompt by passing both the name
and value to `nb set`:

```bash
# set editor with setting name
> nb set editor code
EDITOR set to code

# set editor with setting number (6)
> nb set 6 code
EDITOR set to code

# set the color theme to blacklight
> nb set color_theme blacklight
NB_COLOR_THEME set to blacklight

# set the default `ls` limit to 10
> nb set limit 10
NB_LIMIT set to 10
```

Use `nb settings get` to print the value of a setting:

```bash
> nb settings get editor
code

> nb settings get 6
code
```

Use `nb settings unset` to unset a setting and revert to default:

```bash
> nb settings unset editor
EDITOR restored to the default: vim

> nb settings get editor
vim
```

`nb set` and `nb settings` are aliases that refer to the same subcommand, so
the two subcommand names can be used interchangably.

For more information about `set` and `settings`, see
[`nb help settings`](#settings) and
[`nb settings list --long`](#settings-list---long).

### üé® Color Themes

`nb` uses color to highlight various interface elements, including ids, the
current notebook name, the shell prompt, and divider lines.

`nb` includes several built-in color themes and also supports user-defined
themes. The current color theme can be set using
[`nb set color_theme`](#settings-list---long):

```bash
nb set color_theme
```

|    |    |

#### Custom Color Themes

Custom color themes can be installed in the `${NB_DIR}/.themes` directory.

Themes have a `.nb-theme` or `.nb-theme.sh` extension and contain one `if`
statement indicating the name and setting the color environment variables
to `tput` ANSI color numbers:

```bash
# file: ~/.nb/.themes/example.nb-theme.sh
if [[ "${NB_COLOR_THEME}" == "example" ]]
then
  export NB_COLOR_PRIMARY=43
  export NB_COLOR_SECONDARY=38
fi
```

The primary and secondary colors can be set individually, making color themes
easily customizable:

```bash
# open the settings prompt for the primary color
nb set color_primary

# open the settings prompt for the secondary color
nb set color_secondary
```

To view a table of available colors and numbers, run:

```bash
nb set colors
```

### $ Shell Theme Support

- [`astral` Zsh Theme](https://github.com/xwmx/astral) - Displays the
    current notebook name in the context line of the prompt.

### > `nb` Interactive Shell

`nb` has an interactive shell that can be started with `nb shell`,
`nb -i`, or `nb --interactive`:

```bash
$ nb shell
__          _
\ \   _ __ | |__
 \ \ | '_ \| '_ \
 / / | | | | |_) |
/_/  |_| |_|_.__/
------------------
nb shell started. Enter ls to list notes and notebooks.
Enter help for usage information. Enter exit to exit.
nb> ls

The `nb` shell recognizes all `nb` subcommands and options,
providing a streamlined, distraction-free approach for working with `nb`.

### Shortcut Aliases

Several core `nb` subcommands have single-character aliases to make
them faster to work with:

```bash
# `a` (add): add a new note named "example.md"
nb a example.md

# `b` (bookmark): list bookmarks
nb b

# `o` (open): open bookmark 12 in your web browser
nb o 12

# `p` (peek): open bookmark 6 in your terminal browser
nb p 6

# `e` (edit): edit note 5
nb e 5

# `d` (delete): delete note 19
nb d 19

# `s` (show): show note 27
nb s 27

# `q` (search): search notes for "example query"
nb q "example query"

# `h` (help): display the help information for the `add` subcommand
nb h add

# `u` (use): switch to example-notebook
nb u example-notebook
```

For more commands and options, run `nb help` or `nb help <subcommand>`

### Subcommands

#### `add`

```text
Usage:
  nb add [<filename> | <content>] [-c <content> | --content <content>]
         [--edit] [-e | --encrypt] [-f <filename> | --filename <filename>]
         [-t <title> | --title <title>] [--type <type>]

Options:
  -c, --content <content>     The content for the new note.
  --edit                      Open the note in the editor before saving when
                              content is piped or passed as an argument.
  -e, --encrypt               Encrypt the note with a password.
  -f, --filename <filename>   The filename for the new note. The default
                              extension is used when the extension is omitted.
  -t, --title <title>         The title for a new note. If `--title` is
                              present, the filename will be derived from the
                              title, unless `--filename` is specified.
  --type <type>               The file type for the new note, as a file
                              extension.

Description:
  Create a new note.

  If no arguments are passed, a new blank note file is opened with
  `$EDITOR`, currently set to "example". If a non-option argument is
  passed, `nb` will treat it as a <filename‚â• if a file extension is found.
  If no file extension is found, `nb` will treat the string as
  <content> and will create a new note without opening the editor.
  `nb add` can also create a new note with piped content.

  `nb` creates Markdown files by default. To create a note with a
  different file type, use the extension in the filename or use the `--type`
  option. To change the default file type, use `nb set default_extension`.

  When the `-e` / `--encrypt` option is used, `nb` will encrypt the
  note with AES-256 using OpenSSL by default, or GPG, if configured in
  `nb set encryption_tool`.

Examples:
  nb add
  nb add example.md
  nb add "Note content."
  nb add example.md --title "Example Title" --content "Example content."
  echo "Note content." | nb add
  nb add -t "Secret Document" --encrypt

## Specifications

### `nb` Markdown Bookmark File Format

#### Extension

`.bookmark.md`

#### Description

`nb` bookmarks are Markdown documents created using a combination of
user input and data from the bookmarked page. The `nb` bookmark format
is intended to be readable, editable, and clearly organized for
greatest accessibility.

Bookmarks are identified by a `.bookmark.md` file extension. The
bookmark URL is the first URL in the file within `<` and `>` characters.
To create a minimally valid bookmark file with `nb add`:

```bash
nb add example.bookmark.md --content "<https://example.com>"
```

This creates a file with the name `example.bookmark.md` containing:

```markdown
<https://example.com>
```

In a full bookmark, bookmark information is separated into sections,
with each bookmark section indicated by a Markdown `h2` heading.

#### Example

#### Elements

##### Title

`Optional`

A markdown `h1` heading containing the content of the bookmarked page's
HTML `<title>` or [`og:title`](https://ogp.me/) tag, if present, followed by
the domain within parentheses.

###### Examples

```markdown
# Example Title (example.com)
```
```markdown
# (example.com)
```

##### URL

`Required`

The URL of the bookmarked resource, with surrounding angle brackets
(`<`, `>`).

This is the only required element.

##### `## Description`

`Optional`

A text element containing the content of the bookmarked page's meta description
or [`og:description`](https://ogp.me/) tag, if present.

##### `## Quote`

`Optional`

A markdown quote block containing a user-specified excerpt from the bookmarked
resource.

##### `## Comment`

`Optional`

A text element containing a comment written by the user.

##### `## Related`

`Optional`

A Markdown list of angle bracketed (`<`, `>`) URLs that are related to the
bookmarked resource.

##### `## Tags`

`Optional`

A list of tags represented as hashtags separated by individual spaces.

##### `## Content`

`Optional`

The full content of the bookmarked page, converted to Markdown.

The `## Content` section makes the page content available locally for
full-text search and viewing of page content. The source HTML is converted
to inline Markdown to reduce the amount of markup, make it more readable,
and make page conent easily viewable in the terminal as markdown and
streamlined HTML in terminal web browsers.

##### `## Source`

`Optional`

A fenced code block with `html` language identifier containing the source HTML
from the bookmarked page.

`nb` does not save the page source by default. `nb` uses this section to save
the source HTML page content when `pandoc` is not available to convert it to
Markdown.

### `nb` Notebook Specification

An `nb` notebook is a directory that contains a valid `.git` directory,
indicating that it has been initialized as a git repository, and a `.index`
file.

#### `.index` File

The notebook index is a text file named `.index` in the notebook directory.
`.index` contains a list of filenames, one per line, and the line number of
each filename represents the id. `.index` is included in the git repository
so ids are preserved across systems.

##### Operations

- Add:
  - Append a new line containing the filename to `.index`.
- Update:
  - Overwrite the existing filename in `.index` with the new filename.
- Delete:
  - Delete the filename, preserving the newline, leaving the line blank.

##### `index` Subcommand

`nb` manages the `.index` using an internal `index` subcommand.

###### `nb help index`

```text
Usage:
  nb index add <filename>
  nb index delete <filename>
  nb index get_basename <id>
  nb index get_id <filename>
  nb index get_max_id
  nb index rebuild
  nb index reconcile
  nb index show
  nb index update <existing-filename> <new-filename>
  nb index verify

Subcommands:
  add           Add <filename> to the index.
  delete        Delete <filename> from the index.
  get_basename  Print the filename / basename at the specified <id>.
  get_id        Get the id for <filename>.
  get_max_id    Get the maximum id for the notebook.
  rebuild       Rebuild the index. Some ids might change.
  reconcile     Remove duplicates and update index for added and deleted files.
  show          Print the index.
  update        Overwrite the <existing-filename> entry with <new-filename>.
  verify        Verify that the index matches the notebook contents.

Description:
  Manage the index for the current notebook. This subcommand is used
  internally by `nb` and using it manually will probably corrupt
  the index. If something goes wrong with the index, fix it with
  `nb index reconcile`.

  The index is a text file named '.index' in the notebook directory. .index
  contains a list of filenames and the line number of each filename
  represents the id. .index is included in the git repository so ids are
  preserved across systems.
```

#### Archived Notebooks

A notebook is considered archived when it contains a file named `.archived`
at the root level of the notebook directory.

## Tests

To run the [test suite](test), install
[Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and run `bats test` in the project
root.
